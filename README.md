## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js for data visualizations
- Vue Router for navigation
- Pinia for state management
- PWA with service worker

### Backend
- Netlify Functions (serverless)
- MongoDB Atlas for data storage
- JWT authentication
- Google SSO integration
- Encrypted OAuth token storage

### APIs
- QuickBooks Online REST API
- Pipedrive REST API
- Google Auth Library

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (for local development)
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Google OAuth2 credentials
- QuickBooks Online developer account
- Pipedrive account with API access
- Netlify account (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/bi-forecast.git
   cd bi-forecast
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   ```

4. **Required Environment Variables**
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   MONGODB_DB_NAME=bi-forecast
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-super-secret-encryption-key
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   QBO_CLIENT_ID=your-quickbooks-client-id
   QBO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-quickbooks-client-secret
   QBO_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/qbo-oauth-callback
   URL=http://localhost:8888
   ```

5. **Start development server using Netlify**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts both the Vite dev server and Netlify Functions locally.

### Cloudflare Tunnel Setup (Optional)

For secure external access during development (useful for webhook testing or mobile device testing):

1. **Install cloudflared**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
   
   # Linux
   wget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
   sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
   
   # Windows
   # Download from https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Cloudflare**
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel login
   ```

3. **Create and configure tunnel**
   ```bash
   # Create tunnel
   cloudflared tunnel create bi-forecast-dev
   
   # Get tunnel ID (save this)
   cloudflared tunnel list
   ```

4. **Create config file** (`~/.cloudflared/config.yml`)
   ```yaml
   tunnel: YOUR_TUNNEL_ID
   credentials-file: /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.cloudflared/YOUR_TUNNEL_ID.json
   
   ingress:
     - hostname: your-subdomain.yourdomain.com
       service: http://localhost:8888
     - service: http_status:404
   ```

5. **Run tunnel**
   ```bash
   # In a separate terminal
   cloudflared tunnel run bi-forecast-dev
   ```

6. **Update OAuth redirect URIs**
   - Add your tunnel URL to Google OAuth authorized origins
   - Update QBO redirect URI to use tunnel domain
   - Update `.env` with tunnel URL for `URL` variable

This allows secure HTTPS access to your local development server for webhook testing and mobile device debugging.
